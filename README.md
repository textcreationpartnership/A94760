1. THE TRANSLATOR'S APPENDIX.

    _ CHAP. I. Wherein is ſhewed what the Indulgences before mentioned are, and upon what they are grounded.

    _ CHAP. II. Wherein is ſhewed, That Chriſt hath fully and perfectly made ſatisfaction to God for our ſins, and that the Doctrine of our ſatisfaction overthroweth our Faith and Devotion, and is manifeſtly falſe, is injurious to Chriſt, blaſphemous againſt God, teacheth men to be diſloyal and revengeful, implyeth an impoſſibility, and is alſo needleſs.

    _ CHAP. III. Wherein is ſhewed, that the Papiſts Doctrine of Purgatory overthroweth the Faith of the Goſpel, is againſt the Authority of Chriſt, deſtroyeth the Teſtimony of the Fathers, condemneth the Practice of all Chriſtian Churches, robbeth God of his Juſtice, maketh him a Mocker, and is contradicted by the Romaniſts own Tenents.

    _ CHAP. IV. Wherein is ſhewed, that could a man ſatisfie (as the Papiſts ſay) beyond Gods Juſtice, or the deſert of his ſins, yet thoſe ſatisfactions ſuperabounding, may not be given (as they pretend) to others.
